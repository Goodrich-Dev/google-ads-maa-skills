### Context
The Roll Off Dumpster RSA launched on 4/17 as part of the dedicated-ad-group restructure. After one week it has pulled 295 impressions, 15 clicks (5.08% CTR), and 1 conversion — directionally right — but Google still rates the ad **AVERAGE** and Ad Relevance on the core keywords (`roll off dumpster`, `roll off dumpster rental brightwater`) is still **Below Average**. Expected CTR is Above Average and Landing Page Experience is Average, so the copy fix is specifically about **Ad Relevance and thematic diversity**, not hooks or LP alignment.

The current 15 headlines are heavily repetitive — 13 of 15 contain "Roll Off," which triggers Google's redundancy penalty and keeps ad strength at AVERAGE. The fix is to keep core-keyword density high enough to preserve Ad Relevance (search terms show people are searching `roll off dumpster rental`, `roll off dumpster rental brightwater`, `roll off dumpster rental service`, `same day roll off dumpster`) while adding real diversity across size, use case, price, trust, and CTA angles.

### Pin Recommendations

- **Pin Headline 1 ("Roll Off Dumpster Rental") to H1 only.** This guarantees the core keyword is always in the top slot, which directly addresses the Below Average Ad Relevance. Do not pin H2, H3, or any description — let Google test combinations so ad strength can climb to GOOD/EXCELLENT.
- Keep the DKI headline (#3) unpinned so it rotates naturally into H1/H2/H3 depending on the query.

### Implementation Notes

- **Add this as a new RSA alongside the existing 4/17 RSA — do NOT pause the current one immediately.** Let both serve for 10–14 days so Google can compare. After that window, whichever is winning on CTR and conversions stays; the other pauses.
- **Ad Relevance improvement will show on the QS breakdown at the keyword level**, not inside the RSA itself. Watch "roll off dumpster" and "roll off dumpster rental brightwater" in next week's keyword report — we want to see Ad Relevance move from Below Average to Average.
- **Expect ad strength to climb to GOOD** with these 15 headlines (much more thematic diversity), but Google's rating is not deterministic — if it stays AVERAGE, the headline set can still outperform the current one on CTR and relevance, which is what actually matters.
- **Character counts are verified** — all headlines ≤ 30 chars, all descriptions ≤ 90 chars.
- **Dispatch to change-scripts skill is next** — this copy is staged to be turned into a `AdsApp.newResponsiveSearchAdBuilder()` call in a one-time Google Ads Script (dry-run first, as always).
