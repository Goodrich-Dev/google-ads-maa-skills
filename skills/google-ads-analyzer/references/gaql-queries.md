# GAQL Queries & Export Specifications

This file defines the exact data needed for each diagnostic tier. These queries
serve dual purposes:

1. **MCP Mode**: Execute directly against the Google Ads API when the MCP server
   is connected
2. **Upload Mode**: Define the exact columns the user needs to export, so you can
   provide precise export instructions if they're pulling data manually

## Export Instructions for Account Managers

When the user needs to manually export data, provide these instructions tailored
to whichever reports are needed. Don't dump all of them at once — request only
what the current diagnostic tier requires.

## GAQL Queries for MCP Mode

These queries are designed for the Google Ads MCP server. When the MCP server is
connected, execute them directly. Each query includes the resource, fields, and
any relevant filtering.

### Campaign Summary (Tier 1)

```sql
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.status,

  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.ctr,
  metrics.average_cpc,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value,
  metrics.cost_per_conversion,
  metrics.search_impression_share,
  metrics.search_budget_lost_impression_share,

```

### Keyword Performance with Quality Score (Tier 1-2)

## Which Queries to Run by Tier

**Tier 1 (Foundations)**: Campaign Summary + Keyword Performance (for QS and bid
strategy context) + Geographic Performance + Location Targeting Settings

**Tier 2 (Hygiene)**: All of Tier 1 + Search Terms Report + Ad Copy Performance

**Tier 3 (Structural)**: All of Tier 2 (refresh data if stale). Additional
queries for device/time-of-day segmentation can be constructed by adding
`segments.device` or `segments.hour` to the campaign or keyword queries.

**Tier 4 (Advanced)**: Custom queries based on the specific analysis framework
being applied. See `playbook-frameworks.md`.
