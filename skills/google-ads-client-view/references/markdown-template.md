<!--
STRUCTURAL TEMPLATE for the Google Ads Client View (markdown output).
Reuse the layout; replace every {{TOKEN}}. Charts embed as markdown images
pointing at the two PNGs in the same folder, so the .md previews with charts
inline. Project every section from the MAA per the SKILL.md source map. Do not
invent content the MAA does not contain. No em dashes.
