  Generate production-ready Google Ads Scripts (JavaScript) for automating campaign
  management, data pipelines, monitoring, and reporting. Trigger whenever someone asks to
  write, build, create, or fix a Google Ads script — including BigQuery sync, Quality Score
  tracking, search term mining, conversion health checks, bid/budget automation, alerts, or
  Sheet exports. Also trigger on "Google Ads script for [task]", "automate my Google Ads",
  "write a script that [does X]", "ads script to BigQuery", "budget pacing script", "MCC
  script", or any JavaScript automation within Google Ads. Generates actual script code —
  does NOT analyze performance data (use google-ads-analyzer for MAA reports/audits).
  "Analyze" or "audit" = analyzer skill. "Write a script" or "automate" = this skill.

# Google Ads Script Builder

Generate production-ready Google Ads Scripts that follow Google's conventions, handle errors
gracefully, and are ready to paste into the Google Ads Scripts IDE.

## What This Skill Does

This skill writes complete, working Google Ads Scripts for specific automation tasks. Every
script it produces follows a consistent structure, uses the correct API patterns, and
includes a CONFIG block so the user can customize it without touching the logic. The output
is a single JavaScript file the user can paste directly into the Google Ads Scripts editor.

The skill covers two categories of work:

- **Pattern-based scripts**: Common use cases with well-established approaches (BigQuery
  sync, Quality Score tracking, search term mining, conversion health checks, budget pacing,
  etc.). For these, read the matching reference file before generating code — they contain
  tested patterns and important gotchas.
- **Custom scripts**: One-off automation requests that don't match a known pattern. Use the
  core API reference and code patterns to build these from scratch.

## Before Writing Any Script

1. **Clarify the requirements.** Scripts are specific — a vague ask produces a useless
   script. Understand at minimum: what data or entities the script touches, what action it
   takes (read, write, alert, export), and where the output goes (Sheets, BigQuery, email,
   back into the account).

2. **Determine the scope.** Is this a single-account script or an MCC script that runs
   across multiple accounts? MCC scripts use `AdsManagerApp` as the root and require
   `executeInParallel()` for cross-account work. Single-account scripts use `AdsApp`.

3. **Read the relevant reference file.** If the request matches a known pattern, read the
   corresponding file in `references/` before writing code. These patterns encode lessons
   learned — quota workarounds, date handling edge cases, schema decisions that prevent
   headaches later.

## Script Structure Convention

Every script follows this four-section layout. This is non-negotiable — it makes scripts
readable, maintainable, and reusable across accounts.

```javascript
// ============================================================================
// CONFIGURATION — Edit this section to customize the script
// ============================================================================
const CONFIG = {
  // All user-editable settings go here
  // Group by purpose: output destinations, thresholds, behavior flags
};

// ============================================================================
// UTILITIES — Reusable helper functions
// ============================================================================
// Date formatting, error logging, email sending, sheet helpers

// ============================================================================
// MAIN LOGIC — The core work of the script
// ============================================================================
// Data collection, processing, output writing

// ============================================================================
// ENTRY POINT
// ============================================================================
function main() {
  try {
    // Orchestration logic
  } catch (e) {
    Logger.log('ERROR: ' + e.message);
    // Error notification if configured
  }
}
```

### CONFIG Block Rules

The CONFIG block is the only section a non-technical user should need to touch. Every
configurable value belongs here — no magic numbers buried in logic functions.

Required CONFIG fields for every script:
- `SEND_EMAIL_ON_ERROR: true` and `ERROR_EMAIL: 'user@email.com'` — every script should
  be able to alert on failure
- `TIME_ZONE: 'America/Denver'` — default to Mountain Time (user's timezone), always use
  for date formatting
- `DRY_RUN: true` — for scripts that modify the account, include a dry-run mode that logs
  what would change without actually changing it

Common CONFIG fields by script type:
- **Sheet output**: `SPREADSHEET_URL`, `SHEET_NAME`
- **BigQuery output**: `BQ_PROJECT_ID`, `BQ_DATASET_ID`, `BQ_TABLE_ID`
- **Thresholds**: named descriptively — `MIN_CLICKS_FOR_EVALUATION`, `MAX_CPA_THRESHOLD`
- **Date ranges**: `DATE_RANGE` using Google's predefined constants or custom ranges
- **MCC scripts**: `ACCOUNT_LABEL` to filter which managed accounts to process

### Naming Conventions

- Variables: `lowerCamelCase` — `campaignName`, `totalCost`
- Constants: `ALL_CAPS` — `MAX_CPC`, `SHEET_NAME`
- Functions: `lowerCamelCase` — `getCampaignStats()`, `writeToSheet()`
- CONFIG keys: `ALL_CAPS` — `BQ_PROJECT_ID`, `DATE_RANGE`

### Error Handling

Every script wraps `main()` in try/catch. For scripts that process multiple entities
(campaigns, keywords, accounts), catch errors at the entity level too so one failure
doesn't kill the whole run:

```javascript
for (const campaign of campaigns) {
  try {
    processCampaign(campaign);
  } catch (e) {
    Logger.log('Error processing ' + campaign.getName() + ': ' + e.message);
    errors.push({campaign: campaign.getName(), error: e.message});
  }
}
```

### Date Handling

Dates are a common source of bugs in Google Ads Scripts. Key patterns:

- Use `Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), CONFIG.TIME_ZONE, 'yyyy-MM-dd')` for consistent
  formatting
- GAQL date ranges use `YYYYMMDD` format (no dashes): `segments.date DURING [20260301, 20260327]`
- For "yesterday" in GAQL: use the predefined `YESTERDAY` constant or compute it:
  ```javascript
  const yesterday = new Date();
  yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
  const yyyymmdd = Utilities.formatDate(yesterday, CONFIG.TIME_ZONE, 'yyyyMMdd');
  ```
- The predefined date ranges (`LAST_7_DAYS`, `LAST_30_DAYS`, `YESTERDAY`, etc.) are the
  safest option when they fit the use case

## Known Use-Case Patterns

For these common requests, **always read the matching reference file first**. The reference
files contain field-level schema details, tested GAQL queries, and important constraints
that aren't obvious from the API docs alone.

| Request | Reference File | Key Capability |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Sync Google Ads data to BigQuery | `references/bigquery-sync.md` | Daily push of campaign/keyword/search term data to BQ tables |
| Track Quality Score over time | `references/quality-score-tracker.md` | Daily QS snapshots with component breakdown |
| Mine search terms / manage negatives | `references/search-term-mining.md` | Flag waste, stage negative keyword candidates |
| Check conversion tracking health | `references/conversion-health-check.md` | Detect accounts with spend but no conversions firing |
| General API reference | `references/api-reference.md` | Core objects, selectors, GAQL syntax, external services |
| Reusable code patterns | `references/code-patterns.md` | Sheet helpers, email builders, BQ insert functions, MCC patterns |

If the user's request doesn't match a known pattern, use `references/api-reference.md` and
`references/code-patterns.md` to build the script from scratch.

## Reporting: AdsApp.search() vs AdsApp.report()

Both accept GAQL queries. Prefer `AdsApp.search()` for new scripts — it returns structured
`GoogleAdsRow` objects with dot-notation access (`row.campaign.name`,
`row.metrics.clicks`), which is cleaner for programmatic processing.

`AdsApp.report()` returns flat dictionary rows accessed by column name string. It works but
is the older pattern.

```javascript
// Preferred: AdsApp.search()
const rows = AdsApp.search(
  'SELECT campaign.name, metrics.clicks, metrics.cost_micros ' +
  'FROM campaign ' +
  'WHERE campaign.status = "ENABLED" ' +
  'AND segments.date DURING LAST_7_DAYS'
);
for (const row of rows) {
  Logger.log(row.campaign.name + ': ' + row.metrics.clicks + ' clicks');
}
```

Note: `metrics.cost_micros` returns cost in micros (millionths of the account currency).
Divide by 1,000,000 to get the actual dollar amount. This is a common gotcha.

## Mutate Operations

For creating or modifying entities beyond what the built-in object model supports (like
Performance Max campaigns or Demand Gen), use `AdsApp.mutate()` and `AdsApp.mutateAll()`:

```javascript
// Single operation
const result = AdsApp.mutate({
  campaignOperation: {
    update: {
      resourceName: 'customers/123/campaigns/456',
      status: 'PAUSED'
    },
    updateMask: 'status'
  }
});

// Batch operations (can be atomic)
const results = AdsApp.mutateAll(operations, {partialFailure: false});
```

Always include `DRY_RUN` protection around mutate calls. Log what would change before
actually changing it.

## MCC Script Pattern

MCC scripts use `AdsManagerApp` and process accounts in parallel:

```javascript
function main() {
  const accounts = AdsManagerApp.accounts()
    .withCondition("LabelNames CONTAINS 'Active'")
    .get();

  accounts.executeInParallel('processAccount', 'afterAllAccounts');
}

function processAccount() {
  // Runs in the context of each managed account
  // AdsApp refers to the current managed account here
  const accountName = AdsApp.currentAccount().getName();
  // ... do work ...
  return JSON.stringify({account: accountName, results: data});
}

function afterAllAccounts(results) {
  // Consolidation callback — runs after all accounts finish
  for (const result of results) {
    if (result.getStatus() === 'OK') {
      const data = JSON.parse(result.getReturnValue());
      // ... aggregate results ...
    }
  }
}
```

Limits: 50 accounts max per `executeInParallel()`, 30 minutes for parallel work + 30
minutes for the callback. If you have more than 50 accounts, filter by label and run
multiple script instances.

## BigQuery Advanced API

Scripts can write directly to BigQuery via the Advanced API (enabled in script editor under
Advanced APIs → BigQuery). Key objects:

- `BigQuery.Datasets.insert()` — create datasets
- `BigQuery.Tables.insert()` — create tables with schemas
- `BigQuery.Tabledata.insertAll()` — insert rows
- `BigQuery.Jobs.query()` — run SQL queries

See `references/bigquery-sync.md` for the full pattern including schema definition, row
insertion, and error handling.

## Execution Limits to Remember

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Single-account script timeout | 30 minutes |
| MCC parallel timeout | 30 min parallel + 30 min callback |
| Iterator results per selector | 50,000 |
| withIds() per call | 10,000 IDs |
| Mutations per script | 10,000 |
| Max parallel accounts (MCC) | 50 |
| Log output | 100KB truncation |
| Scripts per account | 250 |

If a script is likely to hit the 50,000 iterator limit, use GAQL with pagination or filter
by label/date to stay within bounds.

## Output Requirements

1. **Deliver the complete script as a code block** in the response, ready to paste into the
   Google Ads Scripts IDE
2. **Add a brief setup guide** after the code: what CONFIG values need to be changed, what
   Advanced APIs need to be enabled (if any), and the recommended scheduling frequency
3. **Note any prerequisites** — like enabling BigQuery Advanced API, creating a destination
   Sheet, or having specific labels already set up in the account
4. If the script modifies the account (bids, status changes, budgets), **default DRY_RUN to
   true** and tell the user to run in preview mode first, review the logs, then flip
   DRY_RUN to false
